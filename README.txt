INSTALLING FROM DEV INTO CHROME
	This is a quick guide on how to test out modifications to the source in your own google chrome environment.

	1) Browse to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome
	2) Uninstall any previous versions of the extension that you installed via the chrome web store
	3) On the top right-hand side of the page click "+ Developer mode"
	4) A few more buttons should appear, click the one that says "Load unpacked extension..."
	5) Navigate to the source directory and click ok.  Your done!

	You only have to do this process if your your trying to load an unpacked extension that isn't already loaded.  
	If you want to reload your freshly saved changes, just click reload by the extension logo.


Happy forking!
